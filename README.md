- 👋 My name is Ruvaim and I am interested in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

- 👀 I have experience working with these technologies and have completed several projects utilizing the MERN stack.

- 📫 Feel free to take a look at my repositories to see some of my work.

- 💞️ I am always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges, so if you have an opportunity or project that you think I might be interested in, don't hesitate to reach out!
